Believe it or not, simply having a a website doesn't get you web traffic. Some website are so buried in other search results, they might as well not be on the internet, others do a little better, but they're just shy of making the first page, and let's be honest, only weirdos go past the first page.

So what can we do? Two keywords: *SEO, and content marketing.*

#### What is SEO?
SEO is an acronym for Search Engine Optimization, and it is the first step to getting the keys to the Google kingdom. The title really says it all, Search Engine *Optimization.* This is the process of making sure your website is reaching as many people as it can organically without paying for ads, or sharing your website with all your friends on facebook.



###### So now I know what it is, now how do I do it?
First, things first, you need to answer a couple questions; what is on your site, and what kind of people are you trying to get to visit? Let's say your business is "The Colored Pedal" and you sell flowers. It simply isn't enough to have your business as the title of your landing page, no one knows the name of your business, so no one is typing "The Colored Pedal" into Google. Try using 

> "The Colored Pedal - Flower Arrangements, Floral Design, Wedding Bouquets, ect..." 


Think of as many words as you can to describe your business so you can be sure at least one of those words is in your potential clients search. Think of it less as a title and more of a description.

###### `alt="image title"`
Be sure to fill out the alt attribute on every image tag. The alt tag is the "title" of the image, it acts very similar to the `<title>` tag in html. This is so your image will show up in related Google images searches. Once again try to think of everything you can to describe the image so when people search for those things, your image pops up, increasing the chance of them seeing your site. 

There is much more you can learn about content marketing, and far to much to talk about here, so poke around online and see what else you can find. When you're done with that you're ready for the next step.


#### Content Marketing

Content marketing is the creation of content to promote your website. This can be any kind of content, tweets, blog posts, videos, ect... At the core of every good content marketing strategy is a theme for the content you post. Use your client's social media to find out what they are interested in, then if that lines up with the goals of your business, it's a safe bet that it's a good place for you to create content. Let me give you an example.

Back to the flower example. So you created a twitter for your The Colored Pedal and you start noticing a lot of the people who follow you post about wedding plans. What do you think will get you more sales, tweeting about the new flowers your ordered, or tweeting a link to your store with the title "Our best flowers for weddings."? I'm thinking the latter. Try to find where your business and your clients interest overlap and make content around that. If the content you create is interesting to the type of people you're targeting, they're likely to find it when searching google, and then share it on social media. This can be a big leg up for your business.

>  Since around 2008-2009 just about all my business was generated as a result of my blog. My blog posts and tutorials were gaining substantially more exposure than my portfolio website, so my work was being put in front of a much wider audience.

> Not only this, but the quality of projects were often much higher. Instead of clients finding me through a generic Google search, they were choosing me because they enjoyed my content and saw how much was involved when creating a particular design thanks to the breakdowns I presented through tutorials. This meant projects ran much more smoothly without the usual client nightmares.


Finally I would like to add that having social media share buttons can be a huge help. If the content you are sharing is genuinely interesting, people will want to share it. If this isn't making since to you, feel free to try the buttons on the bottom of this page to get the idea ;). 

And that about wraps it up. I hope this overview was enough to give you an idea of some things you can do to increase web traffic. I also recommend looking more in depth into these subjects.
